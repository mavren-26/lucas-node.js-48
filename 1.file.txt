✅ Why Two Files? (app.js + utils or routes)

In real-world Node.js projects, you never put everything inside one file.
Two-file (or multi-file) architecture makes your backend:

1️⃣ More Organized (Separation of Concerns)

Each file has one responsibility.

File	Responsibility
app.js	Starts server, handles config, imports other modules
utils.js / routes.js	Contains logic (processing, endpoints, functions)

This separation makes code cleaner and easier to understand.

2️⃣ Reusable Code

Let’s say you have a function like:

calculateFrequency()


If it’s inside utils.js, you can call it from:

app.js

controllers

routes

cron jobs

tests

Without rewriting it again.

3️⃣ Easy to Scale

When your app grows to 1000+ lines, keeping everything in one file becomes a nightmare.

By splitting files:

You can create /routes, /controllers, /services, /models

Large systems stay manageable

This is exactly how Express, Google Cloud, Netflix, Amazon backend projects are structured.

4️⃣ Better Debugging

If something is wrong in:

routing → check routes file

business logic → check utils/service file

server config → check app.js

No confusion.
