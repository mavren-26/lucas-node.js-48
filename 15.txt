✅ Problem 1: Build a Rate Limiter (per IP) Without Any Library
Problem Statement

Create a custom middleware in Node.js that limits each IP address to 100 requests per 15 minutes.
If the user exceeds the limit, return:

{ "error": "Too many requests" }

Constraints

No external rate-limit libraries

Store request counts in memory (simple Map)

Use Express middleware

Reset counts after 15 minutes
